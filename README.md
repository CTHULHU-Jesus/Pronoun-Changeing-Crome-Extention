# Pronoun-Changeing-Crome-Extention
Lets users change the pronouns on any website.

## Installation
**TODO** For now just look up *install chrome extension manually* on your favorite search engine.

## Bugs
If you change pronouns to 'they/them' and then to 'he/him' it won't change. You have to reload the web page. This is not the worst bug considering this is intended to be used with fan fiction websites. Witch is just text usually.
